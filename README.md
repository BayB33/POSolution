# POSolution
A project that I had to work on during a recruitment phase.
I had to deliver a working visual for an imaginary POS provider.
First time I used Bootstrap, in the first part of the recruitment they told me they worked with bootstrap and it didn't matter if I didn't knew it yet, that I'll be 
learning it on the job and/or I'll have time to start studying it before being potentially recruited. 
I had 2 weeks to deliver the project so I used that time to learn as much as I could about bootstrap and used it on my project.
I didn't get the job but gained a lot of experience working on this.
